# ChainLink

# This project will provide a simpler method to code your own membership/identity system.
# There are many others out there, we found that MS Simple Membership and the new MS Idenity were first and formost
# much to tightly coupled with the MVC framework. Difficult to customize and way over engineered for a developer who
# has simple User Account / Role Based requirements for their site.

# ChainLink is currently in beta stage but we plan to get a full release out in 2018 (more to come)
